# **SortManager**
The objective of this project is to demonstrate **OOP** and **SOLID** 
principles through an implementation of a sort manager. The project
contains the implementation of 5 sorting algorithms (_**binary-sort**_, _**bubble-sort**_,
_**insertion-sort**_, _**mergesort**_ and _**quicksort**_). The user 
can **choose** any of the **available algorithms and** the **size** of a **randomly
generated array** where the sorting algorithm will perform upon. The **output**
of the program displays the **randomly generated array** based on the given size
the selected **sorting algorithm**, the **sorted array** and the **time taken** for the algorithm
to sort the array.

The project follows the MVC architecture in the sense that the model,
view and controllers lie within different `packages` adhering to the
definition of each of these elements.
